abstract = "Based on field observations in Chongqing, Hubei, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Zhejiang etc. provinces, and comprehensive study on more than 7,000 specimens including 161 type specimens from 20 herbaria, referring to the former results and geographical data, the variation scope of all the morphological characters in _Elaeagnus_ from Mainland China were carefully analysed and discussed. Some reliable diagnostic characters were found, which played an important role in resolving the problems of species delimitations. Then, the classifications of _Elaeagnus_ were primarily researched. The main results were summarized as follows: First, all the morphological characters in _Elaeagnus_ from Mainland China were carefully analysed and discussed. And their taxonomic significance was re-evaluated. The results show that abaxial hairs of leaves, shapes of calyx tube, nature of drupe and fruiting pedicel etc. were constant within species and thus they are good characters for classification. Second, based on above results, taxonomic notes on _Elaeagnus_ in mainland China were made. Thirteen species names and six varieties names were regarded as new synonyms, viz. _Elaeagnus angustata_ (Rehd.) C. Y. Chang var. _songmingensis_ W. K. Hu & H. F. Chow ex C. Y. Chang was regarded as a new synonym of _E. angustata_ (Rehd.) C. Y. Chang, _E. angustifolia_ L. var. _orientalis_ (L.) Kuntze as a new synonym of _E. angustifolia_ L., _E. bockii_ Diels var. _muliensis_ C. Y. Chang as a new synonym of _E. bockii_ Diels, _E. difficilis_ Servettaz var. _brevistyla_ W. K. Hu & H. F. Chow as a new synonym of _E. difficilis_ Servettaz, _E. geniculata_ D. Fang as a new synonym of _E. gonyanthes_ Bentham, _E. griffithii_ Servettaz var. _multiflora_ C. Y. Chang and _E. griffithii_ Servettaz var. _pauciflora_ C. Y. Chang as new synonyms of _E. loureiroi_ Champion ex Bentham, _E. heterophylla_ D. Fang & D. R. Liang and _E. luoxiangensis_ C. Y. Chang as new synonyms of _E. glabra_ Thunb., _E. hunanensis_ C. J. Qi & Q. Z. Lin as a new synonym of _E. lanceolata_ Servettaz subsp. _grandifolia_ Serv., _E. jiangxiensis_ C. Y. Chang as a new synonym of _E. grijsii_ Hance, _E. longiloba_ C. Y. Chang, _E. retrostyla_ C. Y. Chang and _E. xingwenensis_ C. Y. Chang as new synonyms of _E. delavayi_ Lecomte, _E. micrantha_ C. Y. Chang as a new synonym of _E. argyi_ Léveillé, _E. multiflora_ Thunb. var. _siphonantha_ (Nakai) C. Y. Chang as a new synonym of _E. multiflora_ Thunb., _E. obovatifolia_ D. Fang as a new synonym of _E. pingnanensis_ C. Y. Chang, _E. obtusa_ C. Y. Chang as a new synonym of _E. pungens_ Thunb., _E. xichouensis_ C. Y. Chang and _E. xizangensis_ C. Y. Chang as new synonyms of _E. viridis_ Servettaz. Third, two species _E. nanchuanensis_ C. Y. Chang and _E. wushensis_ C. Y. Chang were reinstated as _E. magna_ (Servettaz) Rehder var. _nanchuanensis_ (C. Y. Chang) M. Sun & Q. Lin and _E. magna_ (Servettaz) Rehder var. _wushanensis_ (C. Y. Chang) M. Sun & Q. Lin, respectively. Fourth, after carefully study on the type specimens, lectotypes for five names, viz. _E. luoxiangensis_ C. Y . Chang, _E. micrantha_ C. Y . Chang, _E. pilostyla_ C. Y . Chang, _E. xichouensis_ C. Y . Chang and _E. xingwenensis_ C. Y. Chang, were here designated. Last, as a conclusion, thirty-six species, one subspecies and five varieties were recognized in this genus in mainland China. In addition, descriptions, geographical maps and keys to the taxa of _Elaeagnus_ were given. And also, the patterns of floristic division in China of _Elaeagnus_ were analyzed and discussed."
