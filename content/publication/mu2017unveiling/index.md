abstract = " _Juglans_ species have considerable ecological and economic value worldwide. In China, Wenwan walnuts have been collected by aristocrats and noblemen for more than 2000 years. As a diversity center of Asian _Juglans_, five species are widely distributed in China. The most famous of these is Mahetao ( _J. hopeiensis_ ), which is an uncharacterized species that is mostly cultivated. Wild _J. hopeiensis_ individuals are very rare and are endemic to Hebei province. Because of the minimal variations in previously used molecular markers and the heterogeneity between chloroplast and nuclear genomes, determining the phylogenetic relationships among the _Juglans_ species has been challenging, and has hindered subsequent evolutionary inferences. In this study, we collected enough materials for both cultivated and wild Mahetao to construct well-resolved phylogenetic trees for Asian _Juglans_ species. We used a high-throughput genome-wide restriction site-associated DNA sequencing method. Consequently, the identity of _J. hopeiensis_ has been clearly resolved. Our results indicate that J. hopeiensis is a hybrid of _J. regia_ and _J. mandshurica_. However, _J. hopeiensis_, _J. regia_ and _J. sigillata_ should be considered as a single species from section _Juglans_. Additionally, _J. ailantifolia_, _J. cathayensis_, and _J. mandshurica_ likely represent one species from section _Cardiocaryon_ according to morphological and molecular studies. These results are supported by population structure analysis and morphological comparison. We propose that _J. hopeiensis_ trees growing in the wild should be conserved because of the economic value of their nuts. These trees may be of particular importance to impoverished communities. Furthermore, they may serve as a valuable genetic resource relevant for enhancing the production of edible walnuts. The 2b-RAD method is a viable option for future phylogenetic studies of _Juglans_ species as well as other plant species."
