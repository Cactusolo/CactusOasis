Miao Sun is a postdoctoral fellow at the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu), with [Drs. Douglas and Pamela Soltis](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab).  
Miao has a passionate interest in applying phylogenetic tree as a pivotal framework for solving fundamental issues in biology.

To date, His research has involved following areas:

  * How historical constraints, local adaptation, and species interactions shape biodiversity across an ancient floristic disjunction, i.e, eastern
Asia (EA) and eastern North America (ENA)
  * Use large-scale phylogeny to explore the diversification patterns of rosids, and how it corresponding to climate change.
  * Explore the phylogenetic incongruence among different genomic data resource, and decipher its potential evolutionary cause.
  * Study phylogeny, biogeography, and origin and dispersal for specific group/clade (e.g. *Eleaegnus*).

__Most of the time he is struggling for existence, occasionally he does some coding!__
