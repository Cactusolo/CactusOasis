I'm a postdoctoral fellow in [Plant Evolution & Biodiversity Group](https://pebgroup.github.io/) leading by Dr. [Wolf L. Eiserhardt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X419fPAAAAAJ&hl=de) at [Aarhus University](https://bios.au.dk/) in Denmark. 

Former [Soltis Lab](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab/people/principal-investigators/) member. _Once gator, always gator!_

I have a keen passion for applying phylogenetic tree as a pivotal framework attempting to solve fundamental issues in biology. In my understanding that phylogeny serves as a beautiful platform linking all the biological data together with an evolutionary background.

My research interests are:  

  * Building and using large-scale phylogenetic trees to explore the evolutionary and/or ecological patterns with spatial and/or paleoclimate data. E.g., some workds have done for [rosids]({{< ref "/project/rosids/index.md" >}}).
  
  * Investigating the phylogenetic incongruence among data patitions, and deciphering its potential evolutionary cause  
  
  * Studying phylogeny, biogeography, origin and dispersal for the diverse focal clades (e.g., *Elaeagnus*)
