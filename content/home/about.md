I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Florida Museum of Natural History, with [Drs. Douglas and Pamela Soltis](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab). I have a keen passion for applying phylogenetic tree as a pivotal framework attempting to solve fundamental issues in biology.

To date, my research has involved following areas:

  * How historical constraints, local adaptation, and species interactions shape biodiversity across an ancient floristic disjunction between eastern
Asia (EA) and eastern North America (ENA)
  * Using large-scale phylogeny to explore the diversification patterns of rosids (_a large angiosperm clade, 9,000-12,000 species, with tremendous overall diversity and economic significance_), and how it corresponds to climate change.
  * Exploring the phylogenetic incongruence among data patitions, and deciphering its potential evolutionary cause
  * Studying phylogeny, biogeography, origin and dispersal for the diverse focal clades (e.g., *Elaeagnus*)
