  _**"Dealing with conservation is about dealing with people, not about dealing with animails (and plants)"**   --- Sarah Hauck_
  
  
  _Tree of Life --- A map of the relationships between all life on earth --- A metaphor for the importance and connectivity of all species --- Aiming to increase public understanding of conservation and biodiversity.  The knowledge of Tree of Life has many practical applications which will benifit ourselves._  
  
Under this big project, I have mainly involved fowllowing two subset projects as primary researcher:  
1) **Rosid Phylogeny and Diversification** We recently used 5-locus, 19,740-taxon supermatrix to investigate the sampling bias of rosid in GenBank, and how sampling differences may influence the phylogeny and downstream diversification analyses (See [rosids Project](../rosids/));  

2) **The Tree of Life: China project ( [_Chen et al., 2016_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jse.12215))** We build a tree of life for the plants of China (~30,000 flowering plant species), uncovering a distinct regional pattern in biodiversity. Eastern China is a floral “museum” with a rich array of ancient lineages and distant relatives while the western provinces are an evolutionary “cradle” for newer and more closely related species. More detail see [Lu et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25485?sf180981170=1).
