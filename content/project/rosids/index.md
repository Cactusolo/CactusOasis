# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = " **Rosids**, among the largest clades of angiosperms (90,000â€“120,000 species, ca. 25% of all angiosperms), exhibit tremendous overall diversity in morphology, chemistry, habit, reproductive strategy, and life history. However, our knowledge of this clade is remarkably limited along any sampling metric, hampering efforts to better understand its incredible species diversity."

We recently used large biodiversity datasets representing the state of the art in rosids to understand (1) sampling bias that persists in major flowering plant clades, (2) the association of historical temperature trends with rosid diversification, and (3) the impact of sampling scales on commonly used diversification methods. We used previously published data (Hinchliff et al. 2015; Sun et al., 2016) and generated a new 5-locus, 19,740-taxon supermatrix that doubles sampling of DNA data compared to earlier studies to reconstruct rosid phylogeny. We feel that this paper will be of broad interest to systematic and evolutionary biologists. Even with nearly 20,000 species, our sampling represents < 20% of all rosids, with ecologically important families having sampling as low as 5%. Thus, although angiosperms are often considered well-studied phylogenetically, the rosids exemplify well the poor overall state of knowledge of flowering plants.
