# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = " **Rosids**, among the largest clades of angiosperms (90,000â€“120,000 species, ca. 25% of all angiosperms), exhibit tremendous overall diversity in morphology, chemistry, habit, reproductive strategy, and life history. However, our knowledge of this clade is remarkably limited along any sampling metric, hampering efforts to better understand its incredible species diversity."

We recently used large biodiversity datasets representing the state of the art in rosids to explore (1) [phylogenetic and dating uncertainties, and sampling bias persisted in major flowering plant clades](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/694950v2), and (2) [the impacts of incomplete sampling schemes on different diversification methods]({{< ref "/publication/Sun_rosid3_2020/index.md" >}}); (3) with deep understand of our data and methods, we then further [explored the association betweed rosid diversification and tropicality, and both historical and present-day temperature]({{< ref "/publication/Sun_rosid2_2020/index.md" >}}).   

As more molecular data, species distribution data, and other ecological data available, we'll continously work on developing climatic layers over time that can trace the expansion of strong seasonality, and especially areas with seasonal freezing temperatures.  These layers, when coupled with more fine-grained, modeled past and present species distribution information would provide a strong basis for more explicit testing of current pattern with more mechanism-focused hypothesis.
