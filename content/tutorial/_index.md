I plan to write some simple tutorials (mine or other sources) using **shell** | **R** | **Python** to show that how I achieved those little goals in my projects or daily data analyses. But it may or may not only limited to this, I may also post a tutorial of how [cooking chinese food](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab/2014/02/28/miao-suns-fried-rice-with-egg/), who knows? ;)
