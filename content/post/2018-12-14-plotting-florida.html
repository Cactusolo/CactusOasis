<h1>Ploting Florida</h1>
<p>Today, I learned some “Spatial Analysis” R packages (e.g., <em>ggmap</em>, <em>tigris</em>) from the last workshop of 8-week-long workshop series — <a href="https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/event/introduction-to-r-for-the-social-sciences-weekly-workshops-fall-2018/">R for the Social Sciences Weekly Workshops</a>. It was a really great workshop! I leared a lot of <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Stats</strong> (e.g., Linear Models, Generalized Linear Models, autocorrelation, etc), even though the topics were more focused on Social Sciences.</p>
<p>Thanks to Raffaele Vacca, Tom Smith, and Till Krenz!</p>
<p>Here are some quick and simple code to plot Florida:</p>
