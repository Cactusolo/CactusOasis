All my research is **phylogeny** based. Phylogeny trees are illustrating relationships among organisms. Relationships matter! In my understanding, {{< hl >}}phylogeny serves as a beautiful platform, which links all the biology data together with an evolutionary background{{< /hl >}}. I'm insterested in phylogeny of angiosperms, particularly [rosids]({{< ref "/project/rosids/index.md" >}}).  

I briedly introduced three main research interests:  

  - [Phylogney]({{< ref "/publication/sun2015com/index.md" >}})  
    
  - [Diversification]({{< ref "/project/rosids/index.md" >}})
    
  - [Phylogentic Diversity (PD)]({{< ref "/publication/lu2018evolutionary/index.md" >}})
    
It turned out that people like my talk! :v: :v:
