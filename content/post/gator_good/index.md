summary = "Our world’s heartbeat is its biodiversity. That complex web of life is responsible for the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. But we often don’t realize how much our actions can contribute to the earth’s cultivation or damage. That’s why UF is bringing researchers together from across the country to digitize and map our biodiversity, building a robust catalog of wildlife as the foundation for its preservation. see [Univeristy of Florida on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_FI56liDd4)"

## Saving the Biodiversity on the Earth = Saving Ourselves
#### It's never too big to do something about it

Evolutionary relationship matters! Tree of Life (_phylogeny_) is able to help people with the discovery of medicines, curing diseases, improving crops, identifying conservation priorities, and even predicting the global response of species to a rapidly changing climate. Our knowledge of phylogeny also can help to increase public understanding of conservation, biodiversity, emphasizing the importance and connectivity of all life. See [Soltis and Soltis (2019)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-great-tree-of-life/soltis/978-0-12-812553-3).
