I had the great honor and was invited by Dr. [Zhiduan Chen](http://sourcedb.ib.cas.cn/cn/expert/200904/t20090403_45016.html) to visit his lab. We had great conversations and we also discussed to collaborate a few great project in comming futher.  

Later on I was invited by Dr. [Limin Lu](http://www.lseb.cn/lulimin), who hosted a Youth Forum organized by [the State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany (LSEB)](http://www.lseb.cn/Enindex.aspx) at IBCAS.

I briedly introduced my research works conducted in these 5-year post-doc life in [Soltis Lab](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab/people/principal-investigators/). I used [rosids]({{< ref "../project/rosids/index.md" >}}) as an example to illustrate how to build and use large-scale phylogentic trees. Key points are:  

  - Data mining public database (e.g, GenBank and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)), and data cleaning for downstream analyses. E.g, recent manuscript in [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/694950) and paper in [AJB]({{< ref "/publication/folk2018challenges/index.md" >}}).   
  
  - Knowing the potential issues when applying large-scale data for macro-ecology and -evolution. E.g., papers in [AJB]({{< ref "/publication/folk2018challenges/index.md" >}}), [Ecology]({{< ref "/publication/Lietal2019/index.md" >}}), and another recent manuscript in [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/749325V1).  
    
  - Large-scale trees can be used for [Diversification]. E.g., recent manuscript in [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/749325V1) and an accepted paper collaborated with [Dr. Xue](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/652065v1).
    
  - Large-scale trees can be used for [Phylogentic Diversity (PD)]({{< ref "/publication/lu2018evolutionary/index.md" >}})
  
  **Relationships matter!!**   
    
  Please let me know if you have any questions and want to know more details.
    
Overall, it turned out full house!! More than expected!! :v: :v: 
  
Especially I have met Prof. Jianfeng Mao from Beijing Forestry University. I had great cinversation with him and his students.
